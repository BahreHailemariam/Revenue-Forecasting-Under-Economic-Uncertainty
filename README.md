# 📈 Revenue Forecasting Under Economic Uncertainty

_A Machine Learning + Time Series + Scenario-Modeling Project_

## 📝 Overview

This project predicts future revenue trends for a business operating in unstable economic conditions. The goal is to build a robust forecasting system that:

- Handles **economic shocks** (inflation spikes, recession periods, supply chain disruption)

- Incorporates **external macroeconomic variables** (GDP, CPI, unemployment, consumer sentiment)

- Simulates **multiple what-if scenarios** (best case, base case, worst case)

- Produces **actionable insights** to support strategic planning and finance teams

- Powers **Power BI dashboards** for real-time analysis

The project uses **Python, SQL, Prophet/ARIMA/XGBoost,** and **Power BI.**
